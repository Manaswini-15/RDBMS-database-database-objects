SQL Commands :
  SQL commands are instructions. It is used to communicate with the database. It is also used to perform specific tasks, functions, and queries of data.
  SQL can perform various tasks like create a table, add data to tables, drop the table, modify the table, set permission for users.
  Types of SQL Commands
There are five types of SQL commands: DDL, DML, DCL, TCL, and DQL.
  
  1. Data Definition Language (DDL)
  DDL changes the structure of the table like creating a table, deleting a table, altering a table, etc.
  All the command of DDL are auto-committed that means it permanently save all the changes in the database.
  Here are some commands that come under DDL:

i)CREATE
ii)ALTER
iii)DROP
iv)TRUNCATE

i) CREATE: It is used to create a new table in the database.
Syntax:
CREATE TABLE TABLE_NAME (COLUMN_NAME DATATYPES[,....]);  
Example:
CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE(Name VARCHAR2(20), Email VARCHAR2(100), DOB DATE);

ii)DROP: It is used to delete both the structure and record stored in the table.
Syntax:
DROP TABLE table_name;  
Example:
DROP TABLE EMPLOYEE;  

iii)ALTER: It is used to alter the structure of the database. 
This change could be either to modify the characteristics of an existing attribute or probably to add a new attribute.
Syntax:
To add a new column in the table
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name COLUMN-definition;    

iv)TRUNCATE: It is used to delete all the rows from the table and free the space containing the table.
Syntax:
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;  
Example:
TRUNCATE TABLE EMPLOYEE;  


2.Data Query Language:
DQL is used to fetch the data from the database.

It uses only one command:

SELECT
a. SELECT: This is the same as the projection operation of relational algebra.
It is used to select the attribute based on the condition described by WHERE clause.
Syntax:
SELECT expressions    
FROM TABLES    
WHERE conditions;  
For example:

SELECT emp_name  
FROM employee  
WHERE age > 18; 
3.Data Manipulation Language:
DML commands are used to modify the database. It is responsible for all form of changes in the database.
The command of DML is not auto-committed that means it can't permanently save all the changes in the database. They can be rollback.
Here are some commands that come under DML:

INSERT
UPDATE
DELETE
a. INSERT: The INSERT statement is a SQL query. It is used to insert data into the row of a table.

Syntax:

INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME    
(col1, col2, col3,.... col N)  
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, .... valueN);  
Or
Here are some commands that come under DML:

INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME    
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, .... valueN);    
For example:

INSERT INTO javatpoint (Author, Subject) VALUES ("Sonoo", "DBMS");  
b. UPDATE: This command is used to update or modify the value of a column in the table.

Syntax:

UPDATE table_name SET [column_name1= value1,...column_nameN = valueN] [WHERE CONDITION
For example:

UPDATE students    
SET User_Name = 'Sonoo'    
WHERE Student_Id = '3'  
c. DELETE: It is used to remove one or more row from a table.

Syntax:

DELETE FROM table_name [WHERE condition];  
For example:
DELETE FROM javatpoint  
WHERE Author="Sonoo";
